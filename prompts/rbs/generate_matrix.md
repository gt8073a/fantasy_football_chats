generate a tab-separated list with NO header row that MUST contain ONLY the following columns in this order: Player, Team, Age, Role, Overall Risk, Last Injury. Perform a full health analysis for each player to generate the risk rating.
ONLY output the data, no other text; so no conversation, nothing signifying a code block, jsut the data.
